This repository provide one with the Arduino code to manage and run multiple AI models that automate and optimize the hydroponic agricultural systems. This codebase is designed to integrate seamlessly with hydroponic equipment, facilitating real-time environmental control and decision-making based on AI-driven data analytics.

## Features

- **AI Integration**: Utilizes multiple AI models to analyze and respond to data from environmental sensors.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Ensures the hydroponic system operates within optimal environmental parameters.
- **Automated Adjustments**: Adjusts variables like nutrient levels and lighting automatically based on AI recommendations.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to maintain stability and performance under various conditions.
